        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          We're committed to inspiring young tech enthusiasts in Nepal by
          providing the resources and mentorship they need to thrive. Despite
          the obstacles in our competitive programming landscape, our goal is to
          ensure Nepal's participation in the International Olympiad in
          Informatics (IOI).Through this initiative, we aim to boost student
          engagement in competitive programming and empower young coders to
          represent Nepal on the global stage. Together, we can make a
          meaningful difference and create opportunities for the next generation
          of tech leaders.
